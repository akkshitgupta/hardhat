# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

today i learnt about the hardhat framework for ethers. Now i know: 
- how to add custom tasks in the hardhat
- how to deploy the contract locally as well as on the test net using the RPC URL and private key
- how to verify the contract on the etherscan programtically
- to create a hardhat network locally for development
- adding test to your smart contracts for higher security in the open world, mocha tests are used in it
